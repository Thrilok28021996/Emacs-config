* üß† LYT + Zettelkasten Hybrid Knowledge System

This is a hybrid note-taking system that combines the best of both **Linking Your Thinking (LYT)** and **Zettelkasten** methodologies.

** System Philosophy üéØ

*** LYT Principles (Structure & Navigation)
- **Maps of Content (MOCs)** provide structured overviews
- **Hierarchical organization** with flexible boundaries  
- **Contextual relationships** and thematic groupings
- **Progressive summarization** and idea development
- **Flexible emergence** allowing organic growth

*** Zettelkasten Principles (Connections & Discovery)
- **Atomic notes** with single, focused ideas
- **Unique identifiers** for permanent referencing
- **Surprise connections** through linking
- **Emergence over hierarchy** for new insights
- **Conversation with notes** over time

*** Hybrid Benefits üåü
- **Best of both worlds:** Structure when needed, fluidity when exploring
- **Multiple entry points:** Hierarchical for beginners, networked for experts
- **Natural evolution:** Notes can graduate from atomic to structured
- **Serendipitous discovery:** Within organized frameworks
- **Cognitive flexibility:** Match system to thinking style

** Note Types & When to Use üìù

*** 1. Atomic Note (`atomic-note.org`)
**Purpose:** Single, focused ideas that stand alone
**When to use:**
- Capturing a specific concept, claim, or insight
- Creating building blocks for larger ideas
- When you want maximum linkability
- For evidence-based thinking

**Key features:**
- One idea per note
- Strong evidence focus
- Extensive linking capability
- Certainty and development tracking

*** 2. Fluid Note (`fluid-note.org`)
**Purpose:** Emergent, evolving ideas that haven't crystallized
**When to use:**
- Early-stage thinking and exploration
- When ideas are still shifting and developing
- For capturing emerging patterns
- When you're not sure where an idea will go

**Key features:**
- Evolution tracking
- Tension and paradox exploration
- Branching possibilities
- Serendipity capture

*** 3. Synthesis Note (`synthesis-note.org`)
**Purpose:** Bringing together multiple ideas into new insights
**When to use:**
- Combining concepts from different domains
- Resolving apparent contradictions
- Creating new frameworks or models
- When you've found unexpected connections

**Key features:**
- Multi-source integration
- Validation methods
- Emergent properties identification
- Impact assessment

*** 4. MOC - Map of Content (`moc-template.org`)
**Purpose:** Structured overview of a knowledge domain
**When to use:**
- You have 20+ notes in a topic area
- Need to provide navigation for others
- Want to see the big picture
- Creating learning pathways

**Key features:**
- Hierarchical organization (Tier 1-3)
- Multiple organizational schemes
- Entry points and pathways
- Maintenance tracking

*** 5. Knowledge Hub (`index-hub.org`)
**Purpose:** Master index and navigation center
**When to use:**
- Starting your knowledge system
- Need overview of all domains
- Want to track system health
- Creating personal knowledge dashboard

**Key features:**
- Domain overview and metrics
- Cross-domain bridges
- Quality tracking
- Workflow integration

** Workflow Integration üîÑ

*** Capture Process
1. **Quick Capture:** Use org-roam capture templates
2. **Initial Processing:** Decide note type based on idea maturity
3. **Development:** Let notes evolve between types as needed
4. **Integration:** Link to existing notes and MOCs

*** Connection Strategy
- **Immediate connections:** Link during creation
- **Systematic review:** Weekly connection sessions
- **Serendipitous discovery:** Follow curiosity during browsing
- **MOC maintenance:** Monthly structural updates

*** Quality Assurance
- **Atomic notes:** One clear idea, good evidence
- **Fluid notes:** Track evolution, embrace uncertainty
- **Synthesis notes:** Validate integration claims
- **MOCs:** Maintain navigation effectiveness
- **Hubs:** Monitor system health metrics

** Keybindings & Access üéÆ

*** Org-Roam Captures (SPC n r c)
- `a` - Atomic Note
- `f` - Fluid Note  
- `s` - Synthesis Note
- `m` - MOC (Map of Content)
- `h` - Knowledge Hub
- `l` - Literature Note
- `r` - Research Note

*** Quick Actions
- `SPC n r f` - Find any note
- `SPC n r i` - Insert link to note
- `SPC n r b` - Toggle backlinks buffer
- `SPC n r g` - View knowledge graph
- `SPC n r t` - Add tags
- `SPC n r a` - Add aliases

** File Naming Convention üìÅ

*** Prefixes
- `MOC-` - Maps of Content
- `HUB-` - Knowledge Hubs  
- `synthesis-` - Synthesis Notes
- `fluid-` - Fluid Notes
- `lit-` - Literature Notes
- `research-` - Research Notes
- `YYYYMMDDHHMISS-` - Atomic Notes (timestamp)

*** Examples
- `MOC-20231215123045-machine-learning.org`
- `HUB-20231215123045-personal-knowledge.org`
- `synthesis-20231215123045-ai-consciousness.org`
- `20231215123045-attention-mechanism.org`

** Best Practices üåü

*** Starting Out
1. Create your first **Knowledge Hub** as system center
2. Begin with **Atomic Notes** for specific ideas
3. Create **MOCs** when you have 15-20 notes in an area
4. Use **Fluid Notes** for exploratory thinking
5. **Synthesis Notes** emerge from connecting atomics

*** Maintaining the System
- **Daily:** Add notes, make immediate connections
- **Weekly:** Review fluid notes, update connections  
- **Monthly:** Maintain MOCs, assess hub metrics
- **Quarterly:** System-wide reorganization if needed

*** Connection Strategies
- **Follow curiosity:** Trust your interests for connections
- **Use surprise:** Unexpected links often most valuable
- **Think in relationships:** How do ideas support/contradict?
- **Build bridges:** Connect different domains explicitly
- **Layer connections:** Some immediate, some discovered later

** Evolution Pathways üìà

Notes naturally evolve within the system:

```
Fluid Note ‚Üí Atomic Note ‚Üí Part of Synthesis ‚Üí Included in MOC
     ‚Üì            ‚Üì              ‚Üì                ‚Üì
 (uncertain) ‚Üí (crystallized) ‚Üí (integrated) ‚Üí (organized)
```

*** Graduation Criteria
- **Fluid ‚Üí Atomic:** Idea stabilizes, evidence emerges
- **Atomic ‚Üí Synthesis:** Multiple atomics combine meaningfully  
- **Any ‚Üí MOC inclusion:** Becomes part of larger knowledge domain
- **MOC ‚Üí Hub inclusion:** Domain becomes significant in your system

** System Health Indicators üè•

*** Green (Healthy)
- Regular note creation and connection
- Balance between note types
- Growing MOCs with good navigation
- Increasing synthesis insights
- Active use of backlinks

*** Yellow (Attention Needed)
- Many orphaned notes
- Overemphasis on one note type
- Stale MOCs without updates
- Decreased connection making
- Accumulating fluid notes without development

*** Red (Requires Action)
- No new connections for weeks
- MOCs become overwhelming/unusable
- System complexity exceeds cognitive load
- Notes feel disconnected from goals
- Avoidance of the system

Remember: This is a **living system**. Adapt these templates and processes to match your thinking style and evolving needs.
